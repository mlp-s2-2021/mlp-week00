Jupyter notebooks\n\nA **Jupyter notebook** is a literate programming tool thats allows you to combine text, typeset maths, \nimages, and code (and its output) together in one document. Jupyter notebooks are edited and viewed in \na web browser.\n\nA Jupyter notebook consists of several **cells**, which can be of 2 main types:\n* **Markdown cells**, like this one, contain text formatted using Markdown. They can be edited by \ndouble-clicking on them. Markdown syntax is straightforward -- you can double-click on the Markdown \ncells in this notebook to view the source text. Markdown syntax also supports LaTeX typesetting for \nmaths, both inline using `$...$`, e.g. $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and in display mode using \n`$$...$$`, e.g.\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2e^{-x} \\cos(y). $$\n\n* **Code cells**, like the one below, in which we can type and run Python code interactively. They \nare indicated by `In [ ]:` on the left hand side. Note that cells will be executed in the order you \nrun them (as indicated by the number in the square brackets on the left, to ensure the reproducibility \nof your document is always a good idea to clear all cells and rerun the *entire* document.","metadata":{"cell_id":"00001-f8196d86-a5be-4f65-bac2-f23276b5c290","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n### &diams; Exercise 1\n\nRun the code cell below, you should see the text `This is a code cell!` printed afterwards.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-e37826c3-8482-42fa-a7c3-e1e2ac2051a3","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00002-a7b5825c-bbd2-420b-a11d-082795d37081","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"source_hash":"eb01f365","execution_millis":0,"output_cleared":true,"execution_start":1610377754525,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"print('This is a code cell!')","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n### &diams; Exercise 2\n\nBelow is a markdown cell, try adding some text to it and try using some markdown formatting syntax.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-19ee19e0-01af-4350-8fa2-844143becba2","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00005-eb9c75e1-797f-41bb-b4f7-c5d846651826","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-abdf6680-333f-4337-8e0a-cfb1ba498e30","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.
