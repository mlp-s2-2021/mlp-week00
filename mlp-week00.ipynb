Jupyter notebooks\n\nA **Jupyter notebook** is a literate programming tool thats allows you to combine text, typeset maths, \nimages, and code (and its output) together in one document. Jupyter notebooks are edited and viewed in \na web browser.\n\nA Jupyter notebook consists of several **cells**, which can be of 2 main types:\n* **Markdown cells**, like this one, contain text formatted using Markdown. They can be edited by \ndouble-clicking on them. Markdown syntax is straightforward -- you can double-click on the Markdown \ncells in this notebook to view the source text. Markdown syntax also supports LaTeX typesetting for \nmaths, both inline using `$...$`, e.g. $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and in display mode using \n`$$...$$`, e.g.\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2e^{-x} \\cos(y). $$\n\n* **Code cells**, like the one below, in which we can type and run Python code interactively. They \nare indicated by `In [ ]:` on the left hand side.
